## ICS to CSV

### Investigate the distribution of your friends' birth months and days

- How many people have the same birthday as you?
- Which month contains the most number of birthdays?
- How many birthdays are in each month?
- Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?
- Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday of the year?

## You'll need to export your Facebooks friends' birthdays to a csv file.

2. Call the `icstocsv` function with the downloaded `ics` filepath from Facebook and it will return for you the `csv` file with the name, birthday, year, month and day of your FB friends for you to analyse :)
