# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R

Learn to explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations, acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data, and develop intuition around a data set.

## #1 R Basics

- Learn basic commands of R;
- Practice writing basic R scripts;
- Inspect data sets;
- For this lesson take a look at `1_R_basics.Rmd` and `2_factor_variables.Rmd` files.

## #2 Explore One Variable

- Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set using histograms, boxplots and transforms.
- For this lesson take a look at `one_variable.rmd` file.

## #3 Problem Set: Explore One Variable

- Practice using R functions and univariate visualizations to explore and understand individual variables.
- For this lesson take a look at `one_variable_diamonds.rmd` file.

## #4 Explore Two Variables

- Learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set, including scatter plots, line plots, and correlations.
- For this lesson take a look at `two_variables.rmd` file.

## #5 Problem Set: Explore Two Variables

- Practice using bivariate exploration techniques to explore relationships.
- For this lesson take a look at `two_variables_diamonds.rmd` file.

## #6 Explore Many Variables

- Learn powerful methods for examining relationships among multiple variables, and find out how to reshape your data.
- For this lesson take a look at `many_variables.rmd`, `3_yougurt.rmd and `4_heat_maps.rmd` files.

## #7 Problem Set: Explore Many Variables

- Practice using multivariate techniques to look at more complicated relationships between multiple variables, and find out how to reshape your data.
- For this lesson take a look at `many_variables_diamonds.rmd` file.

## #8 Diamonds and Price Predictions

- A case study where we investigate the diamonds data set to predict the price of a given diamond.
- For this lesson take a look at `diamonds_price_predictions_1.rmd` and `diamonds_price_predictions_2.rmd` files.
