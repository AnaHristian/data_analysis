Data Analyst for Enterprise Nanodegree Scholarship offered by Bertelsmann and Udacity

Data Analysis with Python and SQL
Advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy, complex datasets. You’ll learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, you’ll learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data.

## Intro Project: Explore Weather Trends (5 hrs)
This project will introduce you to the SQL and how to download data from a database. You’ll analyze local
and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global
temperature trends.

## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset (40 hrs)
In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your
findings.

## Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results (45 hrs)
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use
statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and
recommendations in a report.

## Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data (50 hrs)
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you'll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its
quality and tidiness, then clean it. You'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus
showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

## Project 4: Communicate Data Findings (50 hrs)
In this project, you will use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates
your findings to others.
