## Data Analysis Process 

Practice investigating different datasets using Python and its powerful packages for data analysis:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib


### #1. Wine Quality Dataset:
- The entire data analysis process to investigate a dataset on wine quality;
- We're going to investigate this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) on physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wine samples.

### #2. Fuel Economy Dataset:
- Analyzing [fuel economy data provided by the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy);
