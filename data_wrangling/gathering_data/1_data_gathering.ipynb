Every time you open a web page, or download a file, or watch a video, it's HTTP that makes it possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP(S) is a request/response protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your computer, a.k.a. the client, sends a request to a server for some file. For this lesson: \"Get me the file `1-the-wizard-of-oz-1939-film.txt`\", for example. \n",
    "    - `GET` is the name of the HTTP request method (of which there are multiple) used for retrieving data.\n",
    "    - `request` library has a method called `GET` which will send the request for us, return the contents of the file we requested, which we can then save to a file\n",
    "    - import the `os` library so we can store the downloaded file in a folder called `ebert_reviews`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The web server sends back a response. \n",
    "    - If the request is valid: \"Here is the file you asked for:\", then followed by the contents of the `1-the-wizard-of-oz-1939-film.txt` file itself.\n",
