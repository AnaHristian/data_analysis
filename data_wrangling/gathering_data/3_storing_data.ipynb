    "## Storing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing is usually done after cleaning, but it's not always done, which excludes it from being a core part of the data wrangling process. Sometimes you just analyze and visualize and leave it at that, without saving your new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, because storing is performed on cleaned data, we could cover this at the end of Lesson 4 (\"Cleaning Data\"). But since we're covering file formats in this lesson, let's cover it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've assessed and cleaned your data, which includes merging all of these separate pieces of data, which as I mentioned in the last video I took care of behind the scenes for you. What do you want to do next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two popular options:**\n",
    "1. Saving to a database\n",
    "2. Saving to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "## #1 Save to a csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages and disadvantages of flat files were discussed earlier in the lesson in the Flat File Structure concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Great for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "And one of the disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sharing data can be cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the size of this dataset and that it likely won't be shared often, saving to a flat file like a CSV is probably the best solution. With pandas, saving your gathered data to a CSV file is easy. The `to_csv` [DataFrame method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html) is all you need and the only parameter required to save a file on your computer is the file path to which you want to save this file. Often specifying `index=False` is necessary too if you don't want the DataFrame index showing up as a column in your stored dataset. If you had a DataFrame, `df`, and wanted to save to a file named `dataset.csv` with no index column:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Around since the 1970 and is the most common method of accessing data and databases today;\n",
    "* SQL has functions that allow its users to read, manipulate and change data;\n",
    "* SQL:\n",
    "    1. Easy to understand\n",
